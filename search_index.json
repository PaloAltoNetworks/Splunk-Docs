The collaboration delivers operational reporting as well as simplified and configurable dashboard views across Palo Alto Networks family of next-generation firewalls.\nSplunk for Palo Alto Networks leverages the data visibility provided by Palo Alto Networks's firewalls and endpoint protection with Splunk's extensive investigation and visualization capabilities to deliver an advanced security reporting and analysis tool. This app enables security analysts, administrators, and architects to correlate application and user activities across all network and security infrastructures from a real-time and historical perspective.\nComplicated incident analysis that previously consumed days of manual and error-prone data mining can now be completed in a fraction of the time, saving not only manpower but also enabling key enterprise security resources to focus on critical, time-sensitive investigations.\nApp Authors:\nBrian Torres-Gil -- email - splunkbase - github\nPaul Nguyen -- email - splunkbase - github\nGarfield Freeman -- email - splunkbase - github\nFeatures\nThe Palo Alto Networks App and Add-on have different features that are designed to work together, and with Splunk Enterprise Security when available.\nPalo Alto Networks App\n\nDashboards to track adversary attacks, incidents, SaaS application usage, user activity, system health, configuration changes for audits, malware, GlobalProtect VPN, and other Palo Alto Networks specific features.\nAdvanced correlations in each dashboard\nDatamodels with pivots for easy access to data and visualizations\nLeverage AutoFocus to prioritize attacks and investigations and search for IOC's\nSplunk Adaptive Response integration for automated action and remediation\nIndex the behavioral footprint of malware seen by WildFire\nSync user login events with User-ID\nUse Adaptive Response to share context with Dynamic Address Groups\nUpdate metadata from content packs\nSpecial searchbar commands\nMacros for easy access to logs\n\nPalo Alto Networks Add-on\n\nFully Common Information Model (CIM) compliant and designed for use with Splunk Enterprise Security\nField extraction for Palo Alto Networks logs from Firewalls, Panorama, Traps Endpoint Security, and Aperture SaaS Application Security\nLeverage threat intelligence from MineMeld and AutoFocus\nIP Classification tailored to your network environment\nDesignate SaaS applications as sanctioned or unsanctioned for your organization\nApp and Threat metadata from the Palo Alto Networks content and signature packs\n\nRequirements\nThe Palo Alto Networks App and Add-on for Splunk has varying system requirements depending on the number of logs sent to Splunk. The firewall administrator has granular control over the quantity of logs sent. The more logs sent to Splunk, the more visibility is available into the traffic on the network.\nIf the compute resources of the servers are oversubscribed, the firewall administrator can reduce the volume of logs sent from the firewall by turning off unnecessary logs. Common high-volume low-value candidates are traffic start logs, non-container URL logs, benign WildFire logs, and logs from policy rules that pass a lot of traffic that is not highly relevant (eg. local SAN traffic).\nApp:\nThe Palo Alto Networks App for Splunk contains a datamodel and dashboards. The dashboards use the datamodel to pull logs quickly for visualization. The dashboards don't require a lot of compute resources or memory, and neither does the datamodel once it is built. However, the process of building the datamodel is very CPU intensive, and is an ongoing process as new logs are indexed and need to be added to the datamodel summary index. By building the datamodel and spending the compute resources to summarize the data when logs are indexed, it allows the dashboards and visualizations to pull the data quickly without intensive compute.\nCare should be taken to ensure the datamodel summary indexing has enough compute resources available to keep up with the flow of logs to the index. If there aren't enough compute resources available, the dashboards may lag behind the data in the index.\nAdd-on:\nThe Palo Alto Networks Add-on for Splunk handles the parsing of the logs into the index. It is highly optimized, but can require significant compute resources for high volumes of logs.\n"},"webinars-and-videos.html":{"url":"webinars-and-videos.html","title":"Webinars and Videos","keywords":"","body":"Webinars and Videos\nLearn more about the Palo Alto Networks App and Add-on for Splunk with these webinars and videos:\nWebinar:\n\nWhy use the Palo Alto Networks App for Splunk:\n\nOverview of App features:\n\n\nDeep-dive into App features:\n"},"faq.html":{"url":"faq.html","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","keywords":"","body":"Frequently Asked Questions\nWhy use Splunk with my Palo Alto Networks products?\nPalo Alto Networks products provide exceptional levels of visibility into network traffic and malicious activity, both in the network and on the endpoint. Combining this visibility with Splunk allows a customer to make correlations and perform analytics around different kinds of data. These correlations can be between different kinds of Palo Alto Networks data, for example, correlating WildFire reports against traffic logs to detect infected hosts, or correlating firewall logs with endpoint logs. But the real power of Splunk is correlations and analytics across multiple sources of data and multiple vendors, for example, correlating firewall logs with webserver logs, or advanced endpoint security logs with Windows event logs.\nWhy use Palo Alto Networks with my Splunk?\nSplunk has unmatched ability to consume and analyze data, but for Splunk to present usable and actionable insights, it must have the highest level of visibility and knowledge possible. Palo Alto Networks provides that level of visibility into the network and the endpoint to detect and even predict malicious activity. When an indicator of compromise is detected, Palo Alto Networks and Splunk work together to take action and remediate problems automatically to keep the network secure.\nWhat can the Palo Alto Networks Splunk App do?\nThe Splunk for Palo Alto Networks app is one of the most downloaded apps for Splunk and is completely free. Splunk apps tell Splunk how to handle data and come with dashboards that display visualizations and analysis of the data. The Splunk for Palo Alto Networks app brings in syslogs from firewalls, Panorama, and Traps Endpoint Security Manager and makes the data easily searchable, analyzes the data with correlations, and displays the data including any anomalies visually. When actionable alerts are produced, Splunk can take action by leveraging the firewall and Panorama APIs to add context that the firewall uses to prevent targeted threats.\nLearn more:  \n\nFeatures\nAdvanced Features\n\nWhat kinds of data does the app take in?\nThe Splunk for Palo Alto Networks app accepts syslogs from Firewalls, Panorama, and Endpoint Security Manager. Also, WildFire malware reports are pulled from the WildFire portal as XML. These reports represent a behavioral fingerprint of any malware detected by WildFire which you can correlate against other logs to detect indicators of compromise.\nDoes the app have a Data Model?\nYes! In Splunk 6.x, the data model feature allows Splunk users to quickly visualize and analyze data with a point-and-click interface (instead of the Splunk searchbar language). This capability requires that the data be modeled into a Splunk Data Model which is a highly accelerated summary index of the data. Not only is there a data model for all Palo Alto Networks logs, all the app's dashboards are based on this accelerated data model for extremely fast data retrieval and visualization. So the app itself is using the same Data Model that Splunk administrators would use to generate visualizations.\nDoes the app conform to the Common Information Model?\nYes! The Common Information Model (CIM) is a set of standards and an app that help other apps conform to a common naming and tagging scheme. This allows Splunk users to search for data across multiple kinds of logs from multiple vendors using the same field names to access the data, which eases correlations across different kinds of data. For example, a Splunk user could correlate between firewall logs and webserver logs. The Splunk for Palo Alto Networks app conforms strictly to the Common Information Model.\nDoes the app work with the Splunk Enterprise Security app?\nYes! The Splunk Enterprise Security app (or \"ES\"), is a set of security log parsers and security related dashboards that conform to the Common Information Model. The Enterprise Security app contains a TA (parsers) for Palo Alto Networks firewall logs. The Splunk for Palo Alto Networks app and Enterprise Security app can be used individually, or together. The Palo Alto Networks Add-on 3.7 supports the new Adaptive Response capabilities of Splunk Enterprise Security.\nI use Splunk ES with the Palo Alto Add-on (TA), why use the App?\nThe Palo Alto Networks App offers significant additional benefits including:\n\nTake immediate action to stop threats with automated remediation\nIndex the behavioral footprint of malware seen by Wildfire\nSync user logins from authentication logs to User-ID\nUpdate content pack metadata for apps and threats\nDatamodel with Pivots for easy access to data and visualizations\nMacros for easy access to logs\nDashboards to track SaaS application usage, user activity, system health, configuration changes for audits, Wildfire malware, and other Palo Alto Networks specific features.\n\nMy question isn't answered here, how do I get answers?\nHere are a few ways to get your questions answered. Search for answers in this order:\n\nCheck the App Documentation at http://pansplunk.readthedocs.io\nSearch on Splunk Answers\nIf you can't find an answer or need support, ask a question using the instructions on the Get Support page.\n\n"},"troubleshoot.html":{"url":"troubleshoot.html","title":"Troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":"Troubleshooting\nCommon Problems and Solutions\nProblem after upgrading the App/Add-on\nCheck the Release Notes for actions needed during App/Add-on upgrade and ensure you completed all required actions for upgrade.\nWhen upgrading any app in Splunk, configuration created by the Splunk administrator is leftover in the app's local directory. If the file in the local directory in the app is not compatible with the new version, then unexpected problems can happen. This is true for all apps in Splunk and a best practice is to backup and delete the local directory in the app after upgrading it if there are problems after the upgrade. Note that you might need to leave inputs.conf if that is how your logs are getting into Splunk.\nDashboards not working\nAll dashboards have no data\nPerform a search for eventtype=pan with 'All time' as the timeframe. If logs show up, then verify the timestamp of the logs is correct. If it is wrong, check that the clock and timezone on the Firewall/Panorama matches the Splunk server, or use NTP on both. See Time and Timezone Problems below for more detail.\nOnly 'Overview' or 'Real-time Event Feed' dashboard has data\nThe 'Overview' dashboard has data, but other dashboards do not, usually datamodel acceleration is disabled or the datamodel is not fully built. This can happen on a Splunk server with not enough resources to summary index the data as it comes in. Increase the time range on the dashbaords with no data to 'All Time' to see if data shows up. Check the datamodel to see if it is 100% built. See Troubleshooting Step 4 below for more detail.\n'Overview' or 'Real-time Event Feed' dashboard has no data\nThe 'Overview' dashboards has no data, but other dashboards work correctly, the clock on your firewall is a few minutes off, or the timezone is set wrong. The 'Overview' dashboard is a real-time 5 minute search, while the other dashboards pull a larger timeframe from the data model. So the 'Overview' is more suseptible to minor variations in system clock. Please verify the clock and timezone on Splunk and the Firewall/Panorama are set exactly the same.\nTime and Timezone Problems\nThere are a few factors that determine the time and timezone of a log:\n\nThe Splunk server's time and date\nThe Splunk server timezone, or the Splunk container timezone when using Docker\nThe date/time and timezone settings on Firewall, Panorama, or Traps ESM\nThe per-log timezone setting in props.conf\n\nBy default, the App and Add-on do not interpret timezones or have any preconfigured timezone settings.\nFirewall/Panorama and Traps always output logs without a timezone, so the timezone setting is honored, but not included with the log.  For example, if your Firewall is set to 8:00:00 EST, then the time in the syslog will be 8:00:00 (without the EST timezone).\nSplunk always interprets Palo Alto Networks logs as the timezone of the Splunk server (or container).\nTherefor, if a Splunk server and Firewall have the same timezone, then the timestamp will be interpreted correctly by Splunk.  If they have different timezones, then the interpreted time will be offset by the difference in the timezones.  You can overcome this by creating a local/props.conf file that explicitly sets the timezone for the logs.  For example, if Splunk is set to UTC and the Firewall is set to EST, then configure a local props.conf file to interpret the Firewall logs as EST, as they will incorrectly be interpreted as UTC by default.\nAn example timezone setting in props.conf might look like this:\n[host::newyork-firewall-*]\nTZ = US/Eastern\nThis example would cause logs from newyork-firewall-1, newyork-firewall-2, etc. to be interpreted as US/Eastern timezone.\nLogs have only sourcetype of pan:log \nYou set the sourcetype to pan:log in your inputs.conf, however, Splunk parses the logs and changes the sourcetype to a more specific one, including pan:traffic, pan:threat, pan:system, pan:config, and others.\nIf your logs are not getting converted to these other sourcetypes and are instead remaining with the pan:log sourcetype, then there is a parsing issue with the logs. This can happen for several reason, so please check each of these reason until the problem is resolved.  Note that sourcetype changes happen at index-time so only newly received logs will get parsed to a sourcetype.\n\nUse the correct log format. For Firewall or Panorama logs, use the default syslog format. For Traps logs use CEF format.\nFor UDP logs, try adding no_appending_timestamp = true to your inputs.conf.\nEnsure the Palo Alto Networks Add-on is installed on all Indexers and Heavy Forwarders, and configure the inputs.conf on the node receiving the logs.\nIf you're using syslog-ng or another syslog collector with a Splunk Heavy or Universal Forwarder, then syslog-ng can add a prefix to the logs which interferes with parsing. Follow the directions at Syslog-ng and Universal Forwarder to configure syslog-ng to omit this prefix.\n\nNo WildFire Data\nThe WildFire dashboard is empty or no WildFire data is appearing in the index. For Splunk to take advantage of WildFire, you log WildFire events from the Firewall/Panorama first. Splunk will leverage the WildFire cloud API to pull reports and IOC's from the WildFire analysis only after it receives notification of the WildFire event from the Firewall/Panorama.\nSome things to check to get WildFire data into Splunk:\n\nIf upgrading to App 5.3 or higher from a version before 5.3, you must set the WildFire API key in the Add-on Setup Screen, even if you previously set it in the App. See the release notes for more information.\nVerify there are WildFire Submission logs in the Monitor tab on the Firewall/Panorama\nVerify WildFire logs are enabled in the Log Forwarding Profile on the Security policy rule which is generating WildFire events\nVerify WildFire events are received by Splunk with this search: eventtype=pan_wildfire\nIf there are WildFire events (syslogs), verify there are also WildFire reports (XML) with this search: eventtype=pan_wildfire_report\nIf there are WildFire events (syslogs) but not WildFire reports (XML), check the report gathering logs for errors in $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/python.log.\nCheck that you have configured the TA with the WildFire API Key, especially if upgrading from a pre-5.3 version of the App.\n\nDatamodel Build Problems \nIf using App 6.0 or higher, use the Datamodel Audit dashboard to get visibility into the datamodels and what they are storing.\nIf the build percentage is stuck at less than 95%, the cause might be limited resources on the Splunk server being consumed by other apps. Try disabling unused apps, removing acceleration from other datamodels, or adding hardware resources. Splunk Enterprise Security uses an exceptional amount of compute resources which can starve the datamodels of other apps like the Palo Alto Networks App.  If Enterprise Security is installed on the same server as the Palo Alto Networks App, try separating them to different servers so they don't compete for compute resources.\nIf you need help troubleshooting performance problems with datamodels, you can open a case with Splunk Support. Note that Splunk Support will not troubleshoot the Palo Alto Networks App, but they can tell you what is causing any performance problems that prevent your datamodels from accelerating fast enough to keep up with new data.\nTroubleshooting Steps\nFollow these troubleshooting steps if there are problems getting the dashboards to show data.\nStep 1. Check that all initial configuration is complete\n\nVerify inputs.conf is set up per the instructions. inputs.conf must have the line no_appending_timestamp = true for UDP syslogs\nCheck for other inputs.conf outside the App or Add-on that might be using the same port\nCheck the firewall is not using a Custom Log Format (must use the default log format)\nCheck the Endpoint Security Manager is using CEF format\nCheck the firewall is set to log something like system events, config events, traffic events, and so on.\nCheck that the clocks and timezones on the firewall and Splunk server are the same. If they are different, logs will not show up correctly.\nIf using a TCP or SSL port for syslogs, try UDP instead, then switch to TCP or SSL once UDP is working\n\nStep 2. Verify logs are indexed\nUse the method described in the Test the configuration section to produce some syslogs. Verify the logs are reaching the Splunk server by navigating to the Splunk for Palo Alto Networks app, click 'Search' in the navigation bar, then enter:\neventtype=pan\n\nIf no logs show up, then the logs are not getting indexed correctly. Use these steps to find the problem:\n\nVerify the configuration from Step 1 above.\nSwitch the search timeframe to All Time. If logs show up, verify the timestamp is correct on the logs. If time is wrong, check that the Splunk server and firewall have the same time and timezone set. Use NTP if possible.\nUse tcpdump or Wireshark on the Splunk server to verify the logs are actually reaching it.\nVerify the App (and Add-on when using App v5.0 and higher) is installed on all searchheads, indexers, and heavy forwarders.\nIf using App v3.x or 4.x, verify the pan_logs index exists.\n\nStep 3. Verify logs are parsed correctly\nUse the method described above in the Test the configuration section to produce some syslogs. Verify the logs are reaching the Splunk server by navigating to the Palo Alto Networks App, click 'Search' in the navigation bar, and enter the following search:\neventtype=pan_config\n\nIf logs showed in step 2, but no logs show up now, then the logs are not getting parsed correctly:\n\nCheck that you are not using a Custom Log Format in the syslog server setting on the firewall.\nCheck that the inputs.conf file is configured with the line \"no_appending_timestamp = true\" if using UDP syslogs.\nIf you're using a third-party syslog forwarder between the Palo Alto Networks device and Splunk, verify the forwarder isn't modifying the logs.\nVerify the App (and Add-on when using App v5.0 and higher) is installed on all searchheads, indexers, and heavy forwarders.\n\nStep 4. Check acceleration and summary indexing\n\nCheck that the dashboards are populating with data. The Overview (pre-6.0) and Realtime Event Feed (6.0+) dashboards don't use datamodel acceleration, so it should work at this point. If it doesn't, then go back to the previous troubleshooting steps. For all the other dashboards, after 5-8 minutes of syslogging to the Splunk server, the dashboards should populate with data. If the dashboards are populating, then acceleration and summary indexing are working. If not, check the following:\n\nCheck acceleration settings in the data model under Settings > Data Model >and find the Palo Alto Networks datamodels. (There may be 1, 3, or 4 datamodels depending on the App version)\n\nVerify that acceleration is enabled for all Palo Alto Networks datamodels.  See Enable Datamodel Acceleration for guidance to enable the datamodels.\n\nClick the arrow next to the Palo Alto Networks data models and check the data model build percentage. It should be 100% or very close to it.\n\nIf the build percentage is stuck at less than 95%, the cause might be limited resources on the Splunk server being consumed by other apps. Try disabling unused apps, removing acceleration from other datamodels, or adding hardware resources. If you need help troubleshooting performance problems with datamodels, you can open a case with Splunk Support. Note that Splunk Support will not troubleshoot the Palo Alto Networks App, but they can tell you what is causing any performance problems that prevent your datamodels from accelerating fast enough to keep up with new data.\n\n\nStep 5.

However, this can result in duplicate storage of accelerated datamodels. Now, it is recommended to install the App only on Search Heads per the table above. If you have installed the App on Indexers or Heavy Forwarders, please delete the App so only the Add-on remains on those nodes.Earlier versions of the App would install the Add-on automatically. This is no longer allowed by Splunk so since App 5.4.2 you are required to install the App and Add-on individually.Data Model acceleration is no longer enabled by default.

In fact, Palo Alto Networks Next-generation Firewall logs often need to be correlated together, such as joining traffic logs with threat logs, or joining Firewall logs with Traps logs. This page includes a few common examples which you can use as a starting point to build your own correlations.\nCorrelation techniques\nEach of these techniques can be used to perform the same correlation, however, each has a different performance profile. They are listed here in order of increasing search complexity and decreasing time cost. In other words the last technique is the most efficient for Splunk, but the hardest for a human to read.\nEach example will correlate traffic logs and url logs to determine how many bytes have been transferred between each FQDN in the time period. The URL log has a dest_name field with the FQDN and the Traffic log has a bytes_out field, so we need to correlate them to know how many bytes went out for each FQDN. The goal is to visualize possible data exfiltration by showing the total bytes_out for each FQDN.\nCorrelation technique 1: Use a 'join' or 'transaction'\nJoin and Transaction commands are expensive, but conceptually familiar to most people. In a pinch they can be used to get a  view of the data, but if you're making a dashboard on a larger dataset, they can be pretty expensive.\nsourcetype=\"pan:threat\" log_subtype=\"url\"\n  | join type=left session_id [ search sourcetype=\"pan:traffic\" log_subtype=\"end\" ]\n  | stats count, sum(bytes_in), sum(bytes_out) BY dest_name\n  | sort -sum(bytes_out)\nIn this example, we search for all URL logs (which contains the FQDN), then join them with traffic logs generated at the end of a session (which contains the total bytes in and out). The field we join on is session_id. All logs from a specific TCP session will have the same session_id, so it makes a decent correlation point.  See Best correlation fields below for examples where session ID is not enough to correlate logs.\nCorrelation technique 2: Stats correlation\nThis technique is less common, but is very useful. It's faster than a join because it reduces the number of searches required, but not much faster because it still pulls from the index.\nHere we perform the same search as the 'join' above and get the same results, but without using a 'join'.\n(sourcetype=\"pan:threat\" AND log_subtype=\"url\") OR (sourcetype=\"pan:traffic\" AND log_subtype=\"end\")\n  | stats values(sourcetype), values(dest_name) AS dest_name, count, sum(bytes_in) AS bytes_in, sum(bytes_out) AS bytes_out BY session_id\n  | stats sum(count) AS count, sum(bytes_in), sum(bytes_out) BY dest_name\n  | sort -sum(bytes_out)\nIn this example, instead of joining two searches (one for URL logs and one for Traffic) we create a single search that pulls both, then use stats to filter and aggregate the data as we like.  This is much faster then a join because we have only one round-trip to pull data from the index and we have eliminated the expensive join operation and replaced it with a stats groupby operation which is faster. First we group by session_id to perform the correlation, then group by dest_name to build the final table of results we want.\nCorrelation technique 3: Datamodel (tstats)\nThis is by far the fastest correlation technique. In fact, it is the only technique we use in the Palo Alto Networks App for Splunk because of the sheer volume of data and just how much faster this technique is over the others. However, it is also the most complicated search syntax and is completely different than traditional SPL search language, so it takes some getting used to.\nThis technique does not pull from the index, so there are a couple things you need to configure before using it.\nRequirements:\n\nInstall the Palo Alto Networks App for Splunk. It contains a full datamodel for all Palo Alto Networks logs which is where we'll pull the logs from.\nTurn on Datamodel Acceleration for all the Palo Alto Networks datamodels.\n\n| tstats summariesonly=t count, values(log.bytes_in) AS log.bytes_in, values(log.bytes_out) AS log.bytes_out, values(log.dest_name) AS log.dest_name FROM datamodel=\"pan_firewall\" WHERE nodename=\"log.traffic.end\" OR nodename=\"log.url\" GROUPBY log.session_id\n  | rename log.* AS *\n  | stats sum(count) AS count, sum(bytes_in), sum(bytes_out) BY dest_name\n  | sort -sum(bytes_out)\nIn this example, we use a generating command called tstats. Note that generating search commands must be preceded with a 'pipe' | symbol as in the example. The | tstats command pulls from the accelerated datamodel summary data instead of the raw data in the index. This is much faster than using the index. We use summariesonly=t here to force | tstats to pull from the summary data and not the index. By default it will pull from both which can significantly slow down the search.\nNote that every field has a log. prefix which is required when using tstats with Palo Alto Networks logs.\nURL data and Traffic data are pulled in one tstats command, so there is only one round trip to the summary data. Then, we use rename to strip the log. prefix from every field. Then we use the stats command to filter and aggregate similar to the previous techniques.\nBest correlation fields\nEach of the examples above use the session_id field as the correlation point. Session ID is the obvious choice to correlated logs from the firewall. All logs from a specific TCP session will have the same session_id, so Traffic and Threat logs can correlate by this field in many cases.\nHowever, a firewall will run out of session ID's eventually and start to reuse them. For a firewall processing a huge amount of traffic in a vast network, this can happen pretty quickly. Also, there is no gauranteed that two firewalls won't pick the same session ID at the same time to refer to different sessions, since session ID's are not globally unique across all firewalls.\nSo, while session ID is a reasonable correlation point, there exist situations where you might correlate logs together that actually aren't related.\nIf you'd like to enforce a gaurantee that the resulting data is correlated with complete accuracy, you can correlate with multiple fields. The Palo Alto Networks App uses the following fields to perform all correlations:\n\nserial_number\nvsys\nsession_id\nsrc_ip\nsrc_port\n\nBy using all 5 of these fields in your join, search, or tstats command, you can gaurantee accuracy of the correlation at a very small cost to efficiency and readability.\n"},"upgrade.html":{"url":"upgrade.html","title":"Upgrade the App/Add-on","keywords":"","body":"Upgrade to App/Add-on Version 6.0\nNo action is required to upgrade App 5.x or Add-on 3.x to App/Add-on 6.0.

This usually applies if you use Splunk Enterprise Security version 3.x because it comes with TA_paloalto. Recreate any inputs from the old TA in the new TA using the instructions in the Getting Started guide. Check the apps directory in Splunk and take the necessary action according to the table:\n\n\n\nExisting TA\nAction Needed\n\n\n\n\nTA_paloalto\nDelete this TA directory, recreate data inputs in new TA\n\n\nSplunk_TA_paloalto\nNo action required, TA is upgraded automatically by App\n\n\nNo TA installed\nNo action required, TA is installed automatically by App\n\n\n\nIndex\nThe new App 5.0 and Add-on 3.5 do not use the pan_logs index that previous versions used. Now, logs can be stored in any index. Since the App no longer specifies the pan_logs index, if you are upgrading, you will need to specify the index yourself.\nACTION REQUIRED: Create a new index called pan_logs using the Splunk GUI or on the command line. Also, in your Splunk role settings, add the pan_logs index to the list of Indexes searched by default.\nSplunk will not overwrite the data previously indexed, and you will have access to all the data indexed before the upgrade. Logs will continue to be stored in the pan_logs index according to the data inputs from the previous App version, unless otherwise specified. The data input can optionally be changed to store logs in a different index.\nResults still might not show up during a search. This is because the pan_logs index is not searched by default. To add the pan_logs index to the list of indexes searched by default, in your Splunk settings, navigate to Access controls -> Roles -> . Scroll down to the section Indexes searched by default. Move pan_logs (or All non-internal indexes) to the right column.\nLookups\nThe lookups have been moved to the Add-on (TA). However, Splunk Enterprise does not remove lookup tables during the upgrade process. So you must remove the lookup tables from the App after the upgrade, or you will see errors while searching within the App.\nACTION REQUIRED: Delete any lookups in the App that you did not create. If you did not create any lookups in the App directory, then you can safely delete the entire lookup directory from the App. The path to the lookup directory is $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkforPaloAltoNetworks/lookups\nFor example:\nrm -rf $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkforPaloAltoNetworks/lookups\nSourcetype\nThe sourcetype format has changed:\n\n\n\nOld sourcetype\nNew sourcetype\n\n\n\n\npan_log\npan:log\n\n\npan_traffic\npan:traffic\n\n\npan_threat\npan:threat\n\n\npan_config\npan:config\n\n\npan_system\npan:system\n\n\n\nNo action is required. The old sourcetypes will be interpreted as the new sourcetype automatically. Optionally the data input can be changed to store logs with the sourcetype pan:log instead of pan_log. This is more correct, but will not change the way logs are retrieved from the index.\nNoteThe data input should only specify pan:log or pan_log for the sourcetype. The logs are automatically parsed into the other sourcetypes (pan_traffic, pan_threat, etc) by the Add-on, so they should not be referenced in the data input.\n"},"tune-or-reduce-firewall-logs.html":{"url":"tune-or-reduce-firewall-logs.html","title":"Tune or Reduce Firewall Logs","keywords":"","body":"Tune or Reduce Firewall Logs\nThe most common question we get is:\n\n\"The firewall/Panorama produces a lot of logs and it's overwhelming our Splunk license or producing a lot of noise that's hard to filter through. How can I reduce the log volume without losing security visibility?\"\n\nThe firewall offers very granular logging controls, so you can tune and reduce logs to Splunk with extreme precision. Even so, this question is difficult to answer because the answer is different for every organization. So this page is an effort to provide general guidance to help you answer this question for yourself.\nThis page will evolve over time as we get feedback from customers. If it's not a fit for your organization, please let us know at splunkapp@paloaltonetworks.com with specific guidance on how this page can improve to recognize your situation.\nLog Types\nThere are many log types, and not all of them are relevant to every organization. The following table shows the characteristics of the logs types as of PAN-OS 8.1:\n\n\n\nLog Type\nSplunk Sourcetype\nLog Size\nLog Frequency\n\n\n\n\nTraffic\npan:traffic\nLarge\nVery High\n\n\nThreat\npan:threat\nLarge\nLow\n\n\nThreat : url\npan:threat\nLarge\nVery High\n\n\nThreat : file\npan:threat\nLarge\nHigh\n\n\nSystem\npan:system\nMedium\nMedium\n\n\nConfiguration\npan:config\nSmall\nLow\n\n\nCorrelation\npan:correlation\nSmall\nLow\n\n\nHIP Match\npan:hipmatch\nSmall\nMedium\n\n\nUser-ID\nNot supported\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication\nNot supported\n\n\n\n\nTunnel\nNot supported\n\n\n\n\nGTP\nNot supported\n\n\n\n\nSCTP\nNot supported\n\n\n\n\nNote: URL and File logs are of type Threat, but they are called out separately because they have a different frequency than most threat logs.\nYou can see from the table that Traffic logs and URL logs are the most frequent and largest, with File logs coming in second. These log types will make up the bulk of what Splunk has to ingest and index.\nFor more guidance on calculating log sizes and event frequency for your environment, refer to these two articles in the Palo Alto Networks Knowledgebase. They include tools and scripts to pull the logging rate from a live device and calculate the storage needed for retension.\n\nSizing Storage for the Logging Service\nPanorama Sizing and Design Guide\n\nDisable Log Types\nYou can eliminate specific log types that are not of use for your organization. Here are a couple examples:\n\nIf you use Splunk in a SOC for security, but are not responsible for the operational health of the firewalls, you could consider disabling System and Config log types\nTraffic logs are large and frequent. Cut their volume in half by shutting off 'Start' logs in all your firewall rules. 'Start' logs often have an incorrect app anyway, becuase they are logged before the app is fully determined. The 'End' logs will have the correct App and other data such as the session duration. See Session Log Best Practices.\n\nReduce Logs for Specific Endpoints or Threats\nYou can only get so far disabling entire log types. Most organizations need these log types and can't disable all URL or Traffic logs. You can still make an impact by reducing these log types only when they are redundant or unnecessary. You can turn these logs on or off for specific rules which gives you complete control over every log. Here are examples of where you might consider reducing log volume:\n\nBackup software runs every night generating thousands of connections from endpoints to a backup server. Create a rule for this backup app from internal endponts to the backup server which logs only threats, and doesn't log traffic sessions, urls, or files.\nUse of an internal app regularly triggers a vulnerability or spyware alert, however, its determined that this is the normal operation of the app and no risk exists. Create a rule for this specific app and the server it runs on that disables this signature. See How to disable signatures for a specific host\n\nFilter Logs with Syslog-NG\nSome organizations using syslog-ng as a log collector prefer to apply filters in their syslog-ng configuration to drop some logs before they are sent to Splunk. Filter match criteria in syslog-ng is flexible and can even match with regex. The team responsible for log collection can control the filtering of logs without having to access the firewall configuration or make a request to the security team. This method requires knowledge of syslog-ng filter configuration which is outside the scope of this document.

There are multiple types of indicators that can be shared:\n\nDomain\nFile\nIPv4\nURL\n\nEnabling indicator sharing is a two step process.  First, enable the saved searches of the indicator types to be shared.  Second, enable the corresponding threatlists in Splunk Enterprise Security.\nIndicators are shared with Splunk Enterprise Security as a CSV file threatlist.  The saved searches are all set to run once every hour by default.  The Enterprise Security threatlist is set to poll every four hours by default.  So after enabling the desired indicator sharing, you may need to wait for a little time before they show up in Splunk Enterprise Security.\nHere's an example walk through for enabling sharing IPv4 indicators.\nEnable Saved Searches\nNavigate to Settings > Searches, reports, and alerts.\nFind the Generate MineMeld IPv4 Enterprise Security Threatlist saved search, then in the Actions column, click Edit > Enable.\nEnable Enterprise Security Threatlists\nAdd the following four threatlist inputs to the file:\n$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_paloalto/local/inputs.conf (or to your preferred inputs.conf file)\n[threatlist://minemeld_ipv4threatlist]\ndescription = MineMeld IPv4 threatlist indicators for Splunk ES\ninterval = 14400\ndisabled = false\ntype = threatlist\nurl = lookup://minemeld_ipv4threatlist\n\n[threatlist://minemeld_domainthreatlist]\ndescription = MineMeld Domain threatlist indicators for Splunk ES\ninterval = 14400\ndisabled = false\ntype = threatlist\nurl = lookup://minemeld_domainthreatlist\n\n[threatlist://minemeld_urlthreatlist]\ndescription = MineMeld URL threatlist indicators for Splunk ES\ninterval = 14400\ndisabled = false\ntype = threatlist\nurl = lookup://minemeld_urlthreatlist\n\n[threatlist://minemeld_filethreatlist]\ndescription = MineMeld file threatlist indicators for Splunk ES\ninterval = 14400\ndisabled = false\ntype = threatlist\nurl = lookup://minemeld_filethreatlist\n"},"lookups.html":{"url":"lookups.html","title":"Add Context to Searches","keywords":"","body":"Add Context to Splunk Searches\nSubnet and IP Classification\nClassify IP addresses in Splunk by any criteria relevant to your environment.

These lookup tables are responsible for populating the app:xyz and threat:xyz fields used in the dashboards and displayed during a search.\nThe lookup table files are updated with major Add-on releases, but can get out of date between releases. To keep the files up to date, they can be updated dynamically from the content pack metadata in your firewall or Panorama. This is done by creating a saved search inside the Add-on to periodically pull the metadata from the firewall or Panorama and update the lookup tables.\nCreate the following saved searches in the TA, by creating the file: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_paloalto/local/savedsearches.conf :\n[Palo Alto Networks - Retrieve ContentPack Apps]\ncron_schedule = 5 0 * * 6\ndispatch.earliest_time = -1m@m\ndisplayview = flashtimeline\nenableSched = 1\nrealtime_schedule = 0\nrequest.ui_dispatch_view = flashtimeline\nsearch = | pancontentpack  apps | outputlookup createinapp=true app_lookup\ndisabled = 0\n\n[Palo Alto Networks - Retrieve ContentPack Threats]\ncron_schedule = 10 0 * * 6\ndispatch.earliest_time = -1m@m\ndisplayview = flashtimeline\nenableSched = 1\nrealtime_schedule = 0\nrequest.ui_dispatch_view = flashtimeline\nsearch = | pancontentpack  threats | outputlookup createinapp=true threat_lookup\ndisabled = 0\nSet  to the IP or hostname of your Firewall or Panorama. Ensure you set the credentials for this device in the Add-on configuration. See Configure Adaptive Response for more information.\nThis example updates the lookup tables every Saturday at 12:05 AM for apps and 12:10 AM for threats. Change the cron_schedule to your desired update schedule.\nNoteThe Palo Alto Networks App version 5.0 or higher must be installed for the lookup table update to work. But the saved searches must be created in the Add-on, not the App.If using a custom admin role on the firewall, it must have Configuration permissions for the XML API.

For example, you could create a rule in the security policy that blocks any IP address with the tag 'bad-actor'. Initially, no IP addresses would be blocked, but you can create a search in Splunk for criteria that represents a problem device, and trigger a tagging of that IP address with the 'bad-actor' tag. The firewall would add the IP address to the Dynamic Address Group in the policy automatically and begin blocking the IP.\nBlocking a bad actor is just the beginning, and you aren't limited to allow or deny as your options. You could tag an IP address/User for additional scrutiny by the Threat Prevention engine, or as a known trusted server to be given additional permissions.

This assumes that the firewall is getting the login information from AD or some other authentication system, to know what user is logged into the device generating the traffic.\nOften a system like a RADIUS server sends authentication logs to Splunk to be indexed. When these logs arrive at Splunk, Splunk can synchronize with the firewall the knowledge of where users logged in. This keeps the firewall's User-ID up to date for policy enforcement and monitoring. There are two ways to synchronize user-id information to the firewall, depending on how your authentication logs are formatted in Splunk.\nSync user login events with User-ID\nThe Palo Alto Networks firewall will inform Splunk of the user generating each connection or event via the syslogs it sends to Splunk. This assumes that the firewall is getting the login information from AD or some other authentication system, to know what user is logged into the device generating the traffic.\nIf authentication logs are being indexed by Splunk, then Splunk can synchronize knowledge of where users are logged in with the firewall. For example, if Splunk is receiving a radius authentication log where 'user' is the field containing the user who authenticated, and 'ip' is the field containing the IP address where the user logged in, then you can map the user to the ip on the firewall.\nIn this situation, it is often preferred to use Splunk syslog forwarding to a User-ID agent or firewall because it is more efficient. But there are some cases where the user and IP are not in the same log. For example, if an authentication log contains the user and MAC address, and the DHCP log contains the MAC address and IP. A correlation must be done on the MAC address to know which IP the user logged in from. In this situation, the panuserupdate command is the preferred solution.\nSee also:  \n\nSearchbar Command: panuserupdate\n\nMethod 1: Splunk Forwarding\nThis is the recommended method.\nWhen Splunk receives authentication logs from an external system (like a RADIUS server), forward the authentication logs from Splunk to a User-ID Agent or User-ID Firewall. The logs must contain both the user and the IP address where they logged in/out.\nThis method is recommended because it is more efficient.\nStep 1: Configure log forwarding on Splunk http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.3.0/Forwarding/Forwarddatatothird-partysystemsd\nStep 2: Configure syslog receiving on User-ID firewall/agent https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/70/pan-os/pan-os/user-id/configure-user-id-to-receive-user-mappings-from-a-syslog-sender.html\nMethod 2: Searchbar Command\nUse the panuserupdate command that is included with the app.\nFor this method, the logs are not required to contain both the user and ip in the same log. For example, where there is an authentication log with user and MAC address, and a DHCP log with MAC address and IP address. Splunk can do a search correlating the user to the IP using the MAC as the common value, then pass the search results to the panuserupdate command which will update the mapping on the firewall.\nSee panuserupdate in the Searchbar Command documentation.\nMore Information: Distribute User-ID\nTo simplify administration, you can configure one firewall to be the redistribution firewall that collects all the mapping information and shares it with other firewalls. You configure the receiving firewalls to retrieve the mapping information from the redistribution firewall.\n\nConfigure a Firewall to Share User Mapping Data with Other Firewalls https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/70/pan-os/pan-os/user-id/configure-a-firewall-to-share-user-mapping-data-with-other-firewalls.html\n"},"commands.html":{"url":"commands.html","title":"Searchbar Command Reference","keywords":"","body":"Searchbar Commands\nThere are several custom commands in the app that can communicate to the Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewall to make changes.

Your security policy could limit the reach of IP addresses with this tag until the incident is remediated. Or it could present a captive portal to the user indicating the problem and steps to contact IT.\nExample 2:Tag any IP that is generating linux syslogs as a linux host on the firewall. Tag is applied to the firewall with serial 0005001028200 via the Panorama at 10.4.4.4:\nsourcetype=\"linux_messages_syslog\" | pantag panorama=\"10.4.4.4\" serial=\"0005001028200\" ip_field=\"host\" tag=\"linux-host\"\nExample 3:Tag every IP address on the firewall with their Splunk classification (from the IP classification lookup table):\n`pan_traffic` | pantag device=\"10.1.1.1\" ip_field=\"src_ip\" tag_field=\"src_class\"\nExample 4:If anyone tries to connect to www.splunk.com, remove the tag 'suspicious-ip-address' from the IP of the website.

This delay is intentional to prevent accidental DoS scenarios.\npancontentpack\nUpdate the app and threat lookup tables from the latest firewall content pack.\nAdded in App version 5.0\nFor usage instructions, see Update metadata from content packs.\nLegacy commands\npanblock\nDeprecated in App version 4.1. Use pantag instead.\nRemoved in App version 5.2.\nModify the configuration of the firewall address groups to include IP addresses from events in Splunk. This is similar to tagging IP addresses and works the same way, but is much less dynamic than tagging because it is modifying the firewall configuration and requires a configuration commit. :\n`index=pan_logs sourcetype=pan_threat log_subtype=vulnerability | stats dc (src_ip) by (src_ip) | panblock device=\"1.0.0.1\" action=\"add\" group=\"attackers\"`\npanupdate\nDeprecated in App version 5.0. Use panuserupdate instead.\nRemoved in App version 5.2.\nThe Palo Alto Networks firewall will inform Splunk of the user generating each connection via the syslogs it sends to Splunk. This assumes that the firewall is getting the login information from AD or some other authentication system, to know what user is logged into the device generating the traffic.\nIf authentication logs are being indexed by Splunk, then Splunk can share knowledge of where users are logged in to the firewall. For example, if Splunk is receiving a radius authentication log where 'user' is the field containing the user who authenticated, and 'ip' is the field containing the IP address where the user logged in, then you can map the user to the ip on the firewall using the panupdate command like so:\n`index=main sourcetype=radius | rename user AS addruser | rename ip AS addrip | panupdate device=\"192.168.4.211\"`\nThis would cause the firewall with management IP 192.168.4.211 to receive the user-to-IP mapping. The mapping times out after 30 minutes.\n"},"dashboards.html":{"url":"dashboards.html","title":"Dashboard Reference","keywords":"","body":"Dashboard Reference\nThis reference is intended to help you get the most out of the more complex dashboards. Not all dashboards are shown here.\nAll Incidents \nOverview\nThe Incident Feed displays all incidents across all the products in the Palo Alto Networks security platform. An incident is any event that may need attention or investigation. For example, a vulnerability exploit attempt, command and control channel, malicious payload execution on an endpoint, or match on an indicator of compromise are all considered incidents.\nThe All Incidents dashboard summarizes all the incidents from all other dashboards in one place. Incidents displayed here may also be displayed in other dashboards.\nPrioritize Investigations\nMost organizations get more incidents than can feasably be investigated so prioritization is crucial. The incident feed offers methods to prioritize incidents by severity, action taken, and AutoFocus tag. An incident tagged by AutoFocus threat intelligence is a critical attack from a known threat actor, campaign, or malware family. Incidents with an AutoFocus tag should be investigated.\nTake Action\n\nFilter results by selecting a log type or severity from the time charts or using the filters at the top.\nClick a table row in the incident feed to see the details and context of that incident.\n\nIncident Trend Graphs\nEach of the 'per hour' incident trendlines at the top of the All Incidents dashboard pulls from a different kind of log or product.  To populate all the trendlines and thus see all possible incidents, ensure you're sending the needed logs from the right product to populate each incident trend. The following table shows the product and log required for each incident trend, and the Splunk search to bring up these kinds of logs. You can use this search to determine if these logs are in your Splunk index.\n\n\n\nIncident Trend (per hour)\nProduct Required\nSplunk Search Macros\n\n\n\n\nCorrelated Incidents\nFirewall or Panorama sending correlation logs\n`pan_correlation`\n\n\nNetwork Incidents\nFirewall or Panorama sending threat logs\n`pan_threat`\n\n\nEndpoint Incidents\nTraps Endpoint Protection\n`pan_endpoint`\n\n\nAperture SaaS Incidents\nAperture Enterprise SaaS Security\n`pan_aperture`\n\n\nMalicious WildFire Submissions\nWildFire Malware Analysis and a Firewall or Panorama sending WildFire logs\n`pan_wildfire` verdict=\"malicious\"\n\n\n\nAdversary Scoreboard \nOverview\nThe Adversary Scoreboard offers a broad view of the threats to your organization. Threats are displayed by the Threat Actor, Attack Campaign, or Malware Family responsible. Each adversary indicates the scope of the attack and the stage of the attack lifecycle reached by that adversary. Note: AutoFocus Threat Intelligence is required for the Adversary Scoreboard to display information.\nTake Action\nClick a table row to see the incidents attributed to an actor, campaign, or malware family.

These threats can include compliance violations such as HIPAA and PCI, malicious files detected with WildFire, or accidental over-share of critical data.\nTo declare SaaS Applications as sanctioned or unsanctioned, set the sanctioned apps in the lookups/sanctioned_saas.csv lookup table in the Palo Alto Networks Add-on.\nNetwork Security \nNetwork Security data is displayed from Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewalls and Panorama. All network-related threats are shown including Threat Prevention signatures, network floods, spyware, viruses, and more.\nThreat Intelligence \nThreat Intelligence provides insight into the threat indicators being retrieved from MineMeld.  Threat indicators are used within the Palo Alto Networks Splunk app, and can also be exported to Splunk Enterprise Security. This dashboard shows the threat indicators pulled from MineMeld over time for each MineMeld Modular Input.\nTo create a MineMeld Modular Input, see Getting Data Into Splunk from AutoFocus and MineMeld\nReal-time Event Feed \nOverview\nThis is the only real-time dashboard in the entire App and is used primarily for an immediate view of what is coming into Splunk, often for troubleshooting purposes. The default timeframe is realtime over the last 5 minutes.\nDisable Real-time Searches\nSome organizations do not allow real-time searches in their Splunk environment. If this is the case, you have a few options to disabled or remove the real-time search in this dashboard:\nOption 1: Turn on Indexed Real-time SearchesThis is a setting in the Splunk server that can be enabled for all Apps.\nOption 2: Change the timeframe in this dashboardIn the dashboard XML, change earliest from rt-5m to -5m@m and change latest from rt to now.\nOption 3: Remove the Real-time Event Feed dashboardDo this by deleting the file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkforPaloAltoNetworks/default/data/ui/views/realtime_event_feed.xml.\nDatamodel Audit \nMonitor the size, health, and acceleration of the Palo Alto Networks datamodels. This is an excellent tool for troubleshooting dashboards to see why data isn't showing up. All the dashboards except the Real-time Event Feed leverage the datamodel.\n"}}}
