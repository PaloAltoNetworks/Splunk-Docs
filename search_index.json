the App\nPalo Alto Networks and Splunk have partnered to deliver an advanced security reporting and analysis tool. The collaboration delivers operational reporting as well as simplified and configurable dashboard views across Palo Alto Networks family of next-generation firewalls.\nSplunk for Palo Alto Networks leverages the data visibility provided by Palo Alto Networks's Cortex XDR with Splunk's extensive investigation and visualization capabilities to deliver an advanced security reporting and analysis tool. This app enables security analysts, administrators, and architects to correlate application and user activities across all network and security infrastructures from a real-time and historical perspective.\nComplicated incident analysis that previously consumed days of manual and error-prone data mining can now be completed in a fraction of the time, saving not only manpower but also enabling key enterprise security resources to focus on critical, time-sensitive investigations.\nApp Authors:\nBrian Torres-Gil -- email - splunkbase - github\nPaul Nguyen -- email - splunkbase - github\nGarfield Freeman -- email - splunkbase - github\nFeatures\nThe Palo Alto Networks App and Add-on have different features that are designed to work together, and with Splunk Enterprise Security when available.\nPalo Alto Networks App\n\nDashboards to track incidents, SaaS application usage, IoT Security, user activity, system health, configuration changes for audits, malware, GlobalProtect VPN, and other Palo Alto Networks specific features.\nDatamodels with pivots for easy access to data and visualizations\nSplunk Adaptive Response integration for automated action and remediation\nSync user login events with User-ID\nUse Adaptive Response to share context with Dynamic Address/User Groups\nUpdate metadata from content packs\nSpecial searchbar commands\nMacros for easy access to logs\n\nPalo Alto Networks Add-on\n\nFully Common Information Model (CIM) compliant and designed for use with Splunk Enterprise Security\nField extraction for Palo Alto Networks logs from Firewalls, Panorama, Cortex XDR, and Aperture SaaS Application Security\n-   IP Classification tailored to your network environment\nDesignate SaaS applications as sanctioned or unsanctioned for your organization\nApp and Threat metadata from the Palo Alto Networks content and signature packs\n\nRequirements\nThe Palo Alto Networks App and Add-on for Splunk has varying system requirements depending on the number of logs sent to Splunk. The firewall administrator has granular control over the quantity of logs sent. The more logs sent to Splunk, the more visibility is available into the traffic on the network.\nIf the compute resources of the servers are oversubscribed, the firewall administrator can reduce the volume of logs sent from the firewall by turning off unnecessary logs. Common high-volume low-value candidates are traffic start logs, non-container URL logs, benign WildFire logs, and logs from policy rules that pass a lot of traffic that is not highly relevant (eg. local SAN traffic).\nApp:\nThe Palo Alto Networks App for Splunk contains a datamodel and dashboards. The dashboards use the datamodel to pull logs quickly for visualization. The dashboards don't require a lot of compute resources or memory, and neither does the datamodel once it is built. However, the process of building the datamodel is very CPU intensive, and is an ongoing process as new logs are indexed and need to be added to the datamodel summary index. By building the datamodel and spending the compute resources to summarize the data when logs are indexed, it allows the dashboards and visualizations to pull the data quickly without intensive compute.\nCare should be taken to ensure the datamodel summary indexing has enough compute resources available to keep up with the flow of logs to the index. If there aren't enough compute resources available, the dashboards may lag behind the data in the index.\nAdd-on:\nThe Palo Alto Networks Add-on for Splunk handles the parsing of the logs into the index. It is highly optimized, but can require significant compute resources for high volumes of logs.\n"},"webinars-and-videos.html":{"url":"webinars-and-videos.html","title":"Webinars and Videos","keywords":"","body":"Webinars and Videos\nLearn more about the Palo Alto Networks App and Add-on for Splunk with these webinars and videos:\nWebinar:\n\nWhy use the Palo Alto Networks App for Splunk:\n\nOverview of App features:\n\n\nDeep-dive into App features:\n"},"faq.html":{"url":"faq.html","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","keywords":"","body":"Frequently Asked Questions\nWhy use Splunk with my Palo Alto Networks products?\nPalo Alto Networks products provide exceptional levels of visibility into network traffic and malicious activity, both in the network and on the endpoint. Combining this visibility with Splunk allows a customer to make correlations and perform analytics around different kinds of data. These correlations can be between different kinds of Palo Alto Networks data, for example, correlating WildFire reports against traffic logs to detect infected hosts, or correlating firewall logs with endpoint logs. But the real power of Splunk is correlations and analytics across multiple sources of data and multiple vendors, for example, correlating firewall logs with webserver logs, or advanced endpoint security logs with Windows event logs.\nWhy use Palo Alto Networks with my Splunk?\nSplunk has unmatched ability to consume and analyze data, but for Splunk to present usable and actionable insights, it must have the highest level of visibility and knowledge possible. Palo Alto Networks provides that level of visibility into the network and the endpoint to detect and even predict malicious activity. When an indicator of compromise is detected, Palo Alto Networks and Splunk work together to take action and remediate problems automatically to keep the network secure.\nWhat can the Palo Alto Networks Splunk App do?\nThe Splunk for Palo Alto Networks app is one of the most downloaded apps for Splunk and is completely free. Splunk apps tell Splunk how to handle data and come with dashboards that display visualizations and analysis of the data. The Splunk for Palo Alto Networks app brings in syslogs from firewalls, Panorama, and Traps Endpoint Security Manager and makes the data easily searchable, analyzes the data with correlations, and displays the data including any anomalies visually. When actionable alerts are produced, Splunk can take action by leveraging the firewall and Panorama APIs to add context that the firewall uses to prevent targeted threats.\nLearn more:  \n\nFeatures\nAdvanced Features\n\nWhat kinds of data does the app take in?\nThe Splunk for Palo Alto Networks app accepts syslogs from Firewalls, Panorama, and Endpoint Security Manager. Also, WildFire malware reports are pulled from the WildFire portal as XML. These reports represent a behavioral fingerprint of any malware detected by WildFire which you can correlate against other logs to detect indicators of compromise.\nDoes the app have a Data Model?\nYes! In Splunk 6.x, the data model feature allows Splunk users to quickly visualize and analyze data with a point-and-click interface (instead of the Splunk searchbar language). This capability requires that the data be modeled into a Splunk Data Model which is a highly accelerated summary index of the data. Not only is there a data model for all Palo Alto Networks logs, all the app's dashboards are based on this accelerated data model for extremely fast data retrieval and visualization. So the app itself is using the same Data Model that Splunk administrators would use to generate visualizations.\nDoes the app conform to the Common Information Model?\nYes! The Common Information Model (CIM) is a set of standards and an app that help other apps conform to a common naming and tagging scheme. This allows Splunk users to search for data across multiple kinds of logs from multiple vendors using the same field names to access the data, which eases correlations across different kinds of data. For example, a Splunk user could correlate between firewall logs and webserver logs. The Splunk for Palo Alto Networks app conforms strictly to the Common Information Model.\nDoes the app work with the Splunk Enterprise Security app?\nYes! The Splunk Enterprise Security app (or \"ES\"), is a set of security log parsers and security related dashboards that conform to the Common Information Model. The Enterprise Security app contains a TA (parsers) for Palo Alto Networks firewall logs. The Splunk for Palo Alto Networks app and Enterprise Security app can be used individually, or together. The Palo Alto Networks Add-on 3.7 supports the new Adaptive Response capabilities of Splunk Enterprise Security.\nI use Splunk ES with the Palo Alto Add-on (TA), why use the App?\nThe Palo Alto Networks App offers significant additional benefits including:\n\nTake immediate action to stop threats with automated remediation\nSync user logins from authentication logs to User-ID\nUpdate content pack metadata for apps and threats\nDatamodel with Pivots for easy access to data and visualizations\nMacros for easy access to logs\nDashboards to track SaaS application usage, user activity, system health, configuration changes for audits, Wildfire malware, and other Palo Alto Networks specific features.\n\nMy question isn't answered here, how do I get answers?\nHere are a few ways to get your questions answered.

If the file in the local directory in the app is not compatible with the new version, then unexpected problems can happen. This is true for all apps in Splunk and a best practice is to backup and delete the local directory in the app after upgrading it if there are problems after the upgrade. Note that you might need to leave inputs.conf if that is how your logs are getting into Splunk.\nDashboards not working\nAll dashboards have no data\nPerform a search for eventtype=pan with 'All time' as the timeframe. If logs show up, then verify the timestamp of the logs is correct. If it is wrong, check that the clock and timezone on the Firewall/Panorama matches the Splunk server, or use NTP on both. See Time and Timezone Problems below for more detail.\nOnly 'Overview' or 'Real-time Event Feed' dashboard has data\nThe 'Overview' dashboard has data, but other dashboards do not, usually datamodel acceleration is disabled or the datamodel is not fully built. This can happen on a Splunk server with not enough resources to summary index the data as it comes in. Increase the time range on the dashbaords with no data to 'All Time' to see if data shows up. Check the datamodel to see if it is 100% built. See Troubleshooting Step 4 below for more detail.\n'Overview' or 'Real-time Event Feed' dashboard has no data\nThe 'Overview' dashboards has no data, but other dashboards work correctly, the clock on your firewall is a few minutes off, or the timezone is set wrong. The 'Overview' dashboard is a real-time 5 minute search, while the other dashboards pull a larger timeframe from the data model. So the 'Overview' is more suseptible to minor variations in system clock. Please verify the clock and timezone on Splunk and the Firewall/Panorama are set exactly the same.\nTroubleshooting Cortex XDR\nEnable Debug Logging\nIn Splunk, navigate to the Palo Alto Networks Add-on.\nFigure: screenshot\nNavigate to Configuration and click on the logging. Then change the log level to DEBUG.\nFigure: screenshot\nUse this Splunk search to troubleshoot error messages from Cortex XDR.\nindex=\"_internal\" source=\"/opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunk_ta_paloalto_cortex_xdr.log\"\nFigure: screenshot\nTime and Timezone Problems\nThere are a few factors that determine the time and timezone of a log:\n\nThe Splunk server's time and date\nThe Splunk server timezone, or the Splunk container timezone when using Docker\nThe date/time and timezone settings on Firewall, Panorama, or Traps ESM\nThe per-log timezone setting in props.conf\n\nBy default, the App and Add-on do not interpret timezones or have any preconfigured timezone settings.\nFirewall/Panorama and Traps always output logs without a timezone, so the timezone setting is honored, but not included with the log.  For example, if your Firewall is set to 8:00:00 EST, then the time in the syslog will be 8:00:00 (without the EST timezone).\nSplunk always interprets Palo Alto Networks logs as the timezone of the Splunk server (or container).\nTherefor, if a Splunk server and Firewall have the same timezone, then the timestamp will be interpreted correctly by Splunk.  If they have different timezones, then the interpreted time will be offset by the difference in the timezones.  You can overcome this by creating a local/props.conf file that explicitly sets the timezone for the logs.  For example, if Splunk is set to UTC and the Firewall is set to EST, then configure a local props.conf file to interpret the Firewall logs as EST, as they will incorrectly be interpreted as UTC by default.\nAn example timezone setting in props.conf might look like this:\n[host::newyork-firewall-*]\nTZ = US/Eastern\nThis example would cause logs from newyork-firewall-1, newyork-firewall-2, etc. to be interpreted as US/Eastern timezone.\nLogs have only sourcetype of pan:log \nYou set the sourcetype to pan:log in your inputs.conf, however, Splunk parses the logs and changes the sourcetype to a more specific one, including pan:traffic, pan:threat, pan:system, pan:config, and others.\nIf your logs are not getting converted to these other sourcetypes and are instead remaining with the pan:log sourcetype, then there is a parsing issue with the logs. This can happen for several reason, so please check each of these reason until the problem is resolved.  Note that sourcetype changes happen at index-time so only newly received logs will get parsed to a sourcetype.\n\nUse the correct log format. For Firewall or Panorama logs, use the default syslog format. For Traps logs use CEF format.\nFor UDP logs, try adding no_appending_timestamp = true to your inputs.conf.\nEnsure the Palo Alto Networks Add-on is installed on all Indexers and Heavy Forwarders, and configure the inputs.conf on the node receiving the logs.\nIf you're using syslog-ng or another syslog collector with a Splunk Heavy or Universal Forwarder, then syslog-ng can add a prefix to the logs which interferes with parsing. Follow the directions at Syslog-ng and Universal Forwarder to configure syslog-ng to omit this prefix.\n\nNo WildFire Data\nNoteWildFire reports have been deprecated as of App/Add-on 7.0.0 \nThe WildFire dashboard is empty or no WildFire data is appearing in the index. For Splunk to take advantage of WildFire, you log WildFire events from the Firewall/Panorama first. Splunk will leverage the WildFire cloud API to pull reports and IOC's from the WildFire analysis only after it receives notification of the WildFire event from the Firewall/Panorama.\nSome things to check to get WildFire data into Splunk:\n\nIf upgrading to App 5.3 or higher from a version before 5.3, you must set the WildFire API key in the Add-on Setup Screen, even if you previously set it in the App. See the release notes for more information.\nVerify there are WildFire Submission logs in the Monitor tab on the Firewall/Panorama\nVerify WildFire logs are enabled in the Log Forwarding Profile on the Security policy rule which is generating WildFire events\nVerify WildFire events are received by Splunk with this search: eventtype=pan_wildfire\nIf there are WildFire events (syslogs), verify there are also WildFire reports (XML) with this search: eventtype=pan_wildfire_report\nIf there are WildFire events (syslogs) but not WildFire reports (XML), check the report gathering logs for errors in $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/python.log.\nCheck that you have configured the TA with the WildFire API Key, especially if upgrading from a pre-5.3 version of the App.\n\nDatamodel Build Problems \nIf using App 6.0 or higher, use the Datamodel Audit dashboard to get visibility into the datamodels and what they are storing.\nIf the build percentage is stuck at less than 95%, the cause might be limited resources on the Splunk server being consumed by other apps. Try disabling unused apps, removing acceleration from other datamodels, or adding hardware resources. Splunk Enterprise Security uses an exceptional amount of compute resources which can starve the datamodels of other apps like the Palo Alto Networks App.  If Enterprise Security is installed on the same server as the Palo Alto Networks App, try separating them to different servers so they don't compete for compute resources.\nIf you need help troubleshooting performance problems with datamodels, you can open a case with Splunk Support. Note that Splunk Support will not troubleshoot the Palo Alto Networks App, but they can tell you what is causing any performance problems that prevent your datamodels from accelerating fast enough to keep up with new data.\nTroubleshooting Steps\nFollow these troubleshooting steps if there are problems getting the dashboards to show data.\nStep 1. Check that all initial configuration is complete\n\nVerify inputs.conf is set up per the instructions. inputs.conf must have the line no_appending_timestamp = true for UDP syslogs\nCheck for other inputs.conf outside the App or Add-on that might be using the same port\nCheck the firewall is not using a Custom Log Format (must use the default log format)\nCheck the Endpoint Security Manager is using CEF format\nCheck the firewall is set to log something like system events, config events, traffic events, and so on.\nCheck that the clocks and timezones on the firewall and Splunk server are the same. If they are different, logs will not show up correctly.\nIf using a TCP or SSL port for syslogs, try UDP instead, then switch to TCP or SSL once UDP is working\n\nStep 2. Verify logs are indexed\nUse the method described in the Test the configuration section to produce some syslogs. Verify the logs are reaching the Splunk server by navigating to the Splunk for Palo Alto Networks app, click 'Search' in the navigation bar, then enter:\neventtype=pan\n\nIf no logs show up, then the logs are not getting indexed correctly. Use these steps to find the problem:\n\nVerify the configuration from Step 1 above.\nSwitch the search timeframe to All Time. If logs show up, verify the timestamp is correct on the logs. If time is wrong, check that the Splunk server and firewall have the same time and timezone set. Use NTP if possible.\nUse tcpdump or Wireshark on the Splunk server to verify the logs are actually reaching it.\nVerify the App (and Add-on when using App v5.0 and higher) is installed on all searchheads, indexers, and heavy forwarders.\nIf using App v3.x or 4.x, verify the pan_logs index exists.\n\nStep 3. Verify logs are parsed correctly\nUse the method described above in the Test the configuration section to produce some syslogs. Verify the logs are reaching the Splunk server by navigating to the Palo Alto Networks App, click 'Search' in the navigation bar, and enter the following search:\neventtype=pan_config\n\nIf logs showed in step 2, but no logs show up now, then the logs are not getting parsed correctly:\n\nCheck that you are not using a Custom Log Format in the syslog server setting on the firewall.\nCheck that the inputs.conf file is configured with the line \"no_appending_timestamp = true\" if using UDP syslogs.\nIf you're using a third-party syslog forwarder between the Palo Alto Networks device and Splunk, verify the forwarder isn't modifying the logs.\nVerify the App (and Add-on when using App v5.0 and higher) is installed on all searchheads, indexers, and heavy forwarders.\n\nStep 4. Check acceleration and summary indexing\n\nCheck that the dashboards are populating with data. The Overview (pre-6.0) and Realtime Event Feed (6.0+) dashboards don't use datamodel acceleration, so it should work at this point. If it doesn't, then go back to the previous troubleshooting steps. For all the other dashboards, after 5-8 minutes of syslogging to the Splunk server, the dashboards should populate with data. If the dashboards are populating, then acceleration and summary indexing are working. If not, check the following:\n\nCheck acceleration settings in the data model under Settings > Data Model >and find the Palo Alto Networks datamodels. (There may be 1, 3, or 4 datamodels depending on the App version)\n\nVerify that acceleration is enabled for all Palo Alto Networks datamodels.  See Enable Datamodel Acceleration for guidance to enable the datamodels.\n\nClick the arrow next to the Palo Alto Networks data models and check the data model build percentage. It should be 100% or very close to it.\n\nIf the build percentage is stuck at less than 95%, the cause might be limited resources on the Splunk server being consumed by other apps. Try disabling unused apps, removing acceleration from other datamodels, or adding hardware resources. If you need help troubleshooting performance problems with datamodels, you can open a case with Splunk Support. Note that Splunk Support will not troubleshoot the Palo Alto Networks App, but they can tell you what is causing any performance problems that prevent your datamodels from accelerating fast enough to keep up with new data.\n\n\nStep 5.

If you have installed the App on Indexers or Heavy Forwarders, please delete the App so only the Add-on remains on those nodes.Earlier versions of the App would install the Add-on automatically. This is no longer allowed by Splunk so since App 5.4.2 you are required to install the App and Add-on individually.Data Model acceleration is no longer enabled by default. Dashboards will not display any data until the data model is accelerated.\nInstall the App and Add-on\nInstall the Palo Alto Networks App by downloading it from the App homepage, or by installing it from within Splunk.\nFigure: Downloading the App and Add-on from within Splunk Enterprise.\nEnable datamodel acceleration\nIf using the Palo Alto Networks App, you must enable datamodel acceleration to see data in the dashboards. Acceleration is on by default in App 6.0 and lower, and off by default in App 6.1 and higher (due to new Splunk app certification rules)\nEnable it now by navigating to Settings -> Datamodels, then select each Palo Alto Networks datamodel and enable acceleration for a time period of your choice.\nThe time period represents how much data will show in the dashboards, and has a significant impact on storage usage. If unsure, set the acceleration time period to 7 days.\nDatamodel acceleration is not required if using the Add-on only.\nAlternative: Install from Github\nThis App is available on SplunkBase and Github. Optionally, you can clone the GitHub repository to install the App. Please feel free to submit contributions to the App using pull requests on GitHub.\nApp:From the directory $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/, type the following command:\ngit clone https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/SplunkforPaloAltoNetworks.git SplunkforPaloAltoNetworks\nAdd-on:From the directory $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/, type the following command:\ngit clone https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Splunk_TA_paloalto.git Splunk_TA_paloalto\nData Model Acceleration\nThe app dashboard's requires data model acceleration.

In fact, Palo Alto Networks Next-generation Firewall logs often need to be correlated together, such as joining traffic logs with threat logs. This page includes a few common examples which you can use as a starting point to build your own correlations.\nCorrelation techniques\nEach of these techniques can be used to perform the same correlation, however, each has a different performance profile. They are listed here in order of increasing search complexity and decreasing time cost. In other words the last technique is the most efficient for Splunk, but the hardest for a human to read.\nEach example will correlate traffic logs and url logs to determine how many bytes have been transferred between each FQDN in the time period. The URL log has a dest_name field with the FQDN and the Traffic log has a bytes_out field, so we need to correlate them to know how many bytes went out for each FQDN. The goal is to visualize possible data exfiltration by showing the total bytes_out for each FQDN.\nCorrelation technique 1: Use a 'join' or 'transaction'\nJoin and Transaction commands are expensive, but conceptually familiar to most people. In a pinch they can be used to get a  view of the data, but if you're making a dashboard on a larger dataset, they can be pretty expensive.\nsourcetype=\"pan:threat\" log_subtype=\"url\"\n  | join type=left session_id [ search sourcetype=\"pan:traffic\" log_subtype=\"end\" ]\n  | stats count, sum(bytes_in), sum(bytes_out) BY dest_name\n  | sort -sum(bytes_out)\nIn this example, we search for all URL logs (which contains the FQDN), then join them with traffic logs generated at the end of a session (which contains the total bytes in and out). The field we join on is session_id. All logs from a specific TCP session will have the same session_id, so it makes a decent correlation point.  See Best correlation fields below for examples where session ID is not enough to correlate logs.\nCorrelation technique 2: Stats correlation\nThis technique is less common, but is very useful. It's faster than a join because it reduces the number of searches required, but not much faster because it still pulls from the index.\nHere we perform the same search as the 'join' above and get the same results, but without using a 'join'.\n(sourcetype=\"pan:threat\" AND log_subtype=\"url\") OR (sourcetype=\"pan:traffic\" AND log_subtype=\"end\")\n  | stats values(sourcetype), values(dest_name) AS dest_name, count, sum(bytes_in) AS bytes_in, sum(bytes_out) AS bytes_out BY session_id\n  | stats sum(count) AS count, sum(bytes_in), sum(bytes_out) BY dest_name\n  | sort -sum(bytes_out)\nIn this example, instead of joining two searches (one for URL logs and one for Traffic) we create a single search that pulls both, then use stats to filter and aggregate the data as we like.  This is much faster then a join because we have only one round-trip to pull data from the index and we have eliminated the expensive join operation and replaced it with a stats groupby operation which is faster. First we group by session_id to perform the correlation, then group by dest_name to build the final table of results we want.\nCorrelation technique 3: Datamodel (tstats)\nThis is by far the fastest correlation technique. In fact, it is the only technique we use in the Palo Alto Networks App for Splunk because of the sheer volume of data and just how much faster this technique is over the others. However, it is also the most complicated search syntax and is completely different than traditional SPL search language, so it takes some getting used to.\nThis technique does not pull from the index, so there are a couple things you need to configure before using it.\nRequirements:\n\nInstall the Palo Alto Networks App for Splunk. It contains a full datamodel for all Palo Alto Networks logs which is where we'll pull the logs from.\nTurn on Datamodel Acceleration for all the Palo Alto Networks datamodels.\n\n| tstats summariesonly=t count, values(log.bytes_in) AS log.bytes_in, values(log.bytes_out) AS log.bytes_out, values(log.dest_name) AS log.dest_name FROM datamodel=\"pan_firewall\" WHERE nodename=\"log.traffic.end\" OR nodename=\"log.url\" GROUPBY log.session_id\n  | rename log.* AS *\n  | stats sum(count) AS count, sum(bytes_in), sum(bytes_out) BY dest_name\n  | sort -sum(bytes_out)\nIn this example, we use a generating command called tstats. Note that generating search commands must be preceded with a 'pipe' | symbol as in the example. The | tstats command pulls from the accelerated datamodel summary data instead of the raw data in the index. This is much faster than using the index. We use summariesonly=t here to force | tstats to pull from the summary data and not the index. By default it will pull from both which can significantly slow down the search.\nNote that every field has a log. prefix which is required when using tstats with Palo Alto Networks logs.\nURL data and Traffic data are pulled in one tstats command, so there is only one round trip to the summary data. Then, we use rename to strip the log. prefix from every field. Then we use the stats command to filter and aggregate similar to the previous techniques.\nBest correlation fields\nEach of the examples above use the session_id field as the correlation point. Session ID is the obvious choice to correlated logs from the firewall. All logs from a specific TCP session will have the same session_id, so Traffic and Threat logs can correlate by this field in many cases.\nHowever, a firewall will run out of session ID's eventually and start to reuse them. For a firewall processing a huge amount of traffic in a vast network, this can happen pretty quickly. Also, there is no gauranteed that two firewalls won't pick the same session ID at the same time to refer to different sessions, since session ID's are not globally unique across all firewalls.\nSo, while session ID is a reasonable correlation point, there exist situations where you might correlate logs together that actually aren't related.\nIf you'd like to enforce a gaurantee that the resulting data is correlated with complete accuracy, you can correlate with multiple fields. The Palo Alto Networks App uses the following fields to perform all correlations:\n\nserial_number\nvsys\nsession_id\nsrc_ip\nsrc_port\n\nBy using all 5 of these fields in your join, search, or tstats command, you can gaurantee accuracy of the correlation at a very small cost to efficiency and readability.\n"},"tune-or-reduce-firewall-logs.html":{"url":"tune-or-reduce-firewall-logs.html","title":"Tune or Reduce Firewall Logs","keywords":"","body":"Tune or Reduce Firewall Logs\nThe most common question we get is:\n\n\"The firewall/Panorama produces a lot of logs and it's overwhelming our Splunk license or producing a lot of noise that's hard to filter through. How can I reduce the log volume without losing security visibility?\"\n\nThe firewall offers very granular logging controls, so you can tune and reduce logs to Splunk with extreme precision. Even so, this question is difficult to answer because the answer is different for every organization. So this page is an effort to provide general guidance to help you answer this question for yourself.\nThis page will evolve over time as we get feedback from customers. If it's not a fit for your organization, please let us know at splunkapp@paloaltonetworks.com with specific guidance on how this page can improve to recognize your situation.\nLog Types\nThere are many log types, and not all of them are relevant to every organization. The following table shows the characteristics of the most common logs types:\n\n\n\nLog Type\nSplunk Sourcetype\nLog Size\nLog Frequency\n\n\n\n\nTraffic\npan:traffic\nLarge\nVery High\n\n\nThreat\npan:threat\nLarge\nLow\n\n\nThreat : url\npan:threat\nLarge\nVery High\n\n\nThreat : file\npan:threat\nLarge\nHigh\n\n\nSystem\npan:system\nMedium\nMedium\n\n\nConfiguration\npan:config\nSmall\nLow\n\n\nCorrelation\npan:correlation\nSmall\nLow\n\n\nHIP Match\npan:hipmatch\nSmall\nMedium\n\n\n\nNote: URL and File logs are of type Threat, but they are called out separately because they have a different frequency than most threat logs.\nYou can see from the table that Traffic logs and URL logs are the most frequent and largest, with File logs coming in second. These log types will make up the bulk of what Splunk has to ingest and index.\nFor more guidance on calculating log sizes and event frequency for your environment, refer to these two articles in the Palo Alto Networks Knowledgebase. They include tools and scripts to pull the logging rate from a live device and calculate the storage needed for retension.\n\nSizing Storage for the Logging Service\nPanorama Sizing and Design Guide\n\nDisable Log Types\nYou can eliminate specific log types that are not of use for your organization. Here are a couple examples:\n\nIf you use Splunk in a SOC for security, but are not responsible for the operational health of the firewalls, you could consider disabling System and Config log types\nTraffic logs are large and frequent. Cut their volume in half by shutting off 'Start' logs in all your firewall rules. 'Start' logs often have an incorrect app anyway, becuase they are logged before the app is fully determined. The 'End' logs will have the correct App and other data such as the session duration. See Session Log Best Practices.\n\nReduce Logs for Specific Endpoints or Threats\nYou can only get so far disabling entire log types. Most organizations need these log types and can't disable all URL or Traffic logs. You can still make an impact by reducing these log types only when they are redundant or unnecessary. You can turn these logs on or off for specific rules which gives you complete control over every log. Here are examples of where you might consider reducing log volume:\n\nBackup software runs every night generating thousands of connections from endpoints to a backup server. Create a rule for this backup app from internal endponts to the backup server which logs only threats, and doesn't log traffic sessions, urls, or files.\nUse of an internal app regularly triggers a vulnerability or spyware alert, however, its determined that this is the normal operation of the app and no risk exists. Create a rule for this specific app and the server it runs on that disables this signature. See How to disable signatures for a specific host\n\nFilter Logs with Syslog-NG\nSome organizations using syslog-ng as a log collector prefer to apply filters in their syslog-ng configuration to drop some logs before they are sent to Splunk. Filter match criteria in syslog-ng is flexible and can even match with regex. The team responsible for log collection can control the filtering of logs without having to access the firewall configuration or make a request to the security team. This method requires knowledge of syslog-ng filter configuration which is outside the scope of this document.

There are multiple types of indicators that can be shared:\n\nDomain\nFile\nIPv4\nURL\n\nEnabling indicator sharing is a two step process.  First, enable the saved searches of the indicator types to be shared.  Second, enable the corresponding threatlists in Splunk Enterprise Security.\nIndicators are shared with Splunk Enterprise Security as a CSV file threatlist.  The saved searches are all set to run once every hour by default.  The Enterprise Security threatlist is set to poll every four hours by default.  So after enabling the desired indicator sharing, you may need to wait for a little time before they show up in Splunk Enterprise Security.\nHere's an example walk through for enabling sharing IPv4 indicators.\nEnable Saved Searches\nNavigate to Settings > Searches, reports, and alerts.\nFind the Generate MineMeld IPv4 Enterprise Security Threatlist saved search, then in the Actions column, click Edit > Enable.\nEnable Enterprise Security Threatlists\nAdd the following four threatlist inputs to the file:\n$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_paloalto/local/inputs.conf (or to your preferred inputs.conf file)\n[threatlist://minemeld_ipv4threatlist]\ndescription = MineMeld IPv4 threatlist indicators for Splunk ES\ninterval = 14400\ndisabled = false\ntype = threatlist\nurl = lookup://minemeld_ipv4threatlist\n\n[threatlist://minemeld_domainthreatlist]\ndescription = MineMeld Domain threatlist indicators for Splunk ES\ninterval = 14400\ndisabled = false\ntype = threatlist\nurl = lookup://minemeld_domainthreatlist\n\n[threatlist://minemeld_urlthreatlist]\ndescription = MineMeld URL threatlist indicators for Splunk ES\ninterval = 14400\ndisabled = false\ntype = threatlist\nurl = lookup://minemeld_urlthreatlist\n\n[threatlist://minemeld_filethreatlist]\ndescription = MineMeld file threatlist indicators for Splunk ES\ninterval = 14400\ndisabled = false\ntype = threatlist\nurl = lookup://minemeld_filethreatlist\n"},"lookups.html":{"url":"lookups.html","title":"Add Context to Searches","keywords":"","body":"Add Context to Splunk Searches\nSubnet and IP Classification\nClassify IP addresses in Splunk by any criteria relevant to your environment.

These lookup tables are responsible for populating the app:xyz and threat:xyz fields used in the dashboards and displayed during a search.\nThe lookup table files are updated with major Add-on releases, but can get out of date between releases. To keep the files up to date, they can be updated dynamically from the content pack metadata in your firewall or Panorama. This is done by creating a saved search inside the Add-on to periodically pull the metadata from the firewall or Panorama and update the lookup tables.\nCreate the following saved searches in the TA, by creating the file: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_paloalto/local/savedsearches.conf :\n[Palo Alto Networks - Retrieve ContentPack Apps]\ncron_schedule = 5 0 * * 6\ndispatch.earliest_time = -1m@m\ndisplayview = flashtimeline\nenableSched = 1\nrealtime_schedule = 0\nrequest.ui_dispatch_view = flashtimeline\nsearch = | pancontentpack  apps | outputlookup createinapp=true app_lookup\ndisabled = 0\n\n[Palo Alto Networks - Retrieve ContentPack Threats]\ncron_schedule = 10 0 * * 6\ndispatch.earliest_time = -1m@m\ndisplayview = flashtimeline\nenableSched = 1\nrealtime_schedule = 0\nrequest.ui_dispatch_view = flashtimeline\nsearch = | pancontentpack  threats | outputlookup createinapp=true threat_lookup\ndisabled = 0\nSet  to the IP or hostname of your Firewall or Panorama. Ensure you set the credentials for this device in the Add-on configuration. See Configure Adaptive Response for more information.\nThis example updates the lookup tables every Saturday at 12:05 AM for apps and 12:10 AM for threats. Change the cron_schedule to your desired update schedule.\nNoteThe Palo Alto Networks App version 5.0 or higher must be installed for the lookup table update to work. But the saved searches must be created in the Add-on, not the App.If using a custom admin role on the firewall, it must have Configuration permissions for the XML API.

For example, you could create a rule in the security policy that blocks any IP address with the tag 'bad-actor'. Initially, no IP addresses would be blocked, but you can create a search in Splunk for criteria that represents a problem device, and trigger a tagging of that IP address with the 'bad-actor' tag. The firewall would add the IP address to the Dynamic Address Group in the policy automatically and begin blocking the IP.\nBlocking a bad actor is just the beginning, and you aren't limited to allow or deny as your options. You could tag an IP address/User for additional scrutiny by the Threat Prevention engine, or as a known trusted server to be given additional permissions.

This assumes that the firewall is getting the login information from AD or some other authentication system, to know what user is logged into the device generating the traffic.\nOften a system like a RADIUS server sends authentication logs to Splunk to be indexed. When these logs arrive at Splunk, Splunk can synchronize with the firewall the knowledge of where users logged in. This keeps the firewall's User-ID up to date for policy enforcement and monitoring. There are two ways to synchronize user-id information to the firewall, depending on how your authentication logs are formatted in Splunk.\nSync user login events with User-ID\nThe Palo Alto Networks firewall will inform Splunk of the user generating each connection or event via the syslogs it sends to Splunk. This assumes that the firewall is getting the login information from AD or some other authentication system, to know what user is logged into the device generating the traffic.\nIf authentication logs are being indexed by Splunk, then Splunk can synchronize knowledge of where users are logged in with the firewall. For example, if Splunk is receiving a radius authentication log where 'user' is the field containing the user who authenticated, and 'ip' is the field containing the IP address where the user logged in, then you can map the user to the ip on the firewall.\nIn this situation, it is often preferred to use Splunk syslog forwarding to a User-ID agent or firewall because it is more efficient. But there are some cases where the user and IP are not in the same log. For example, if an authentication log contains the user and MAC address, and the DHCP log contains the MAC address and IP. A correlation must be done on the MAC address to know which IP the user logged in from. In this situation, the panuserupdate command is the preferred solution.\nSee also:  \n\nSearchbar Command: panuserupdate\n\nMethod 1: Splunk Forwarding\nThis is the recommended method.\nWhen Splunk receives authentication logs from an external system (like a RADIUS server), forward the authentication logs from Splunk to a User-ID Agent or User-ID Firewall. The logs must contain both the user and the IP address where they logged in/out.\nThis method is recommended because it is more efficient.\nStep 1: Configure log forwarding on Splunk http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.3.0/Forwarding/Forwarddatatothird-partysystemsd\nStep 2: Configure syslog receiving on User-ID firewall/agent https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/70/pan-os/pan-os/user-id/configure-user-id-to-receive-user-mappings-from-a-syslog-sender.html\nMethod 2: Searchbar Command\nUse the panuserupdate command that is included with the app.\nFor this method, the logs are not required to contain both the user and ip in the same log. For example, where there is an authentication log with user and MAC address, and a DHCP log with MAC address and IP address. Splunk can do a search correlating the user to the IP using the MAC as the common value, then pass the search results to the panuserupdate command which will update the mapping on the firewall.\nSee panuserupdate in the Searchbar Command documentation.\nMore Information: Distribute User-ID\nTo simplify administration, you can configure one firewall to be the redistribution firewall that collects all the mapping information and shares it with other firewalls. You configure the receiving firewalls to retrieve the mapping information from the redistribution firewall.\n\nConfigure a Firewall to Share User Mapping Data with Other Firewalls https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/70/pan-os/pan-os/user-id/configure-a-firewall-to-share-user-mapping-data-with-other-firewalls.html\n"},"commands.html":{"url":"commands.html","title":"Searchbar Command Reference","keywords":"","body":"Searchbar Commands\nThere are several custom commands in the app that can communicate to the Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewall to make changes.

This assumes that the firewall is getting the login information from AD or some other authentication system, to know what user is logged into the device generating the traffic.\nIf authentication logs are being indexed by Splunk, then Splunk can share knowledge of where users are logged in to the firewall. For example, if Splunk is receiving a radius authentication log where 'user' is the field containing the user who authenticated, and 'ip' is the field containing the IP address where the user logged in, then you can map the user to the ip on the firewall using the panupdate command like so:\n`index=main sourcetype=radius | rename user AS addruser | rename ip AS addrip | panupdate device=\"192.168.4.211\"`\nThis would cause the firewall with management IP 192.168.4.211 to receive the user-to-IP mapping. The mapping times out after 30 minutes.\n"}}}
